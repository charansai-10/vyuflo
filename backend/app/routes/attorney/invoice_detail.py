invoice_detail_router.py — V1 API routes for Invoice Detail (Screen 21).

FILE LOCATION
    app/routes/attorney/invoice_detail.py

Route map (4 endpoints):

  GET    /billing/invoices/{invoice_id}/detail                    → Full invoice detail
  PATCH  /billing/invoices/{invoice_id}                           → Edit details / tax / settings
  POST   /billing/invoices/{invoice_id}/line-items                → Add line item
  DELETE /billing/invoices/{invoice_id}/line-items/{line_item_id} → Remove line item

All endpoints:
  • Require JWT (get_current_user)
  • Scoped to the authenticated attorney's own invoices
  • Use existing permissions: invoices:read, invoices:update

Existing endpoints reused AS-IS from billing_router (NOT duplicated here):
  PATCH  /billing/invoices/{invoice_id}/status  → Send Invoice / Save Draft / Void
  GET    /billing/invoices                       → Back to Invoices list
  POST   /billing/invoices                       → New Invoice button
  POST   /billing/time-entries                   → Log Time button

Register in main.py BEFORE billing_router:
  from app.routes.attorney.invoice_detail import invoice_detail_router
  app.include_router(invoice_detail_router, prefix="/api/v1/billing",
                     tags=["Screen 21 - Invoice Detail"])
